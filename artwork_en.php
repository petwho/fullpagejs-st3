						<h3>Papaya Leaf</h3>

						<p>Summer has never been cooler under the broad canopy of papaya leaves. It was the hub for us kids to

						play games and embrace our childhood without getting tired. The sunlight shinning through the papaya

						leaves reflects on the tile floor magical tapestries that weave in our childhood fairy tales. The more radiant

						is the sunlight, the greener are the leaves, and the darker is the shade. We used to play the prince and

						princess game, imagining a young and innocent love. During the winter as the leaves get dried up, we

						embroidered seven of the papaya leaves border on a silk scarf for a forever warm and strong love.</p>

						<h3>Sacred Fig leaf (Bodhi Leaf)</h3>
						<p>When I was a little kid, on every full moon, my grandmother always took me to the temple to pick up luck

						charms for the year. The lucky charm is usually a beautiful and green Bodhi leaf, as big as my hand with

						very long stem. It’s been told that these leaves provide a calm and cool shade all year round for the

						Buddha. When the color green started to fade, my grandmother reserved the leaf by soaking it in rice

						water. After the decomposition process, what stays intact is a beautiful structure of leaf veins–a sculptural

						masterpiece of god. Bodhi leaf has remained the source of peace for my soul.</p>

						<h3>Banana Leaf</h3>

						<p>During those early days, the adult often told us the story about the “bogeyman” hiding behind the banana

						leaves in our backyard to get us to take lunch nap and to avoid the burning summer sun. With half-closed

						eyes pretending to sleep, I always wondered about the “dark secret” behind those banana leaves. As I

						approached and got my hand on these giant leaves, stripping them one by one like a beautiful feather, I

						slipped into a dream of the color green. The fragrance from the leaf still lingers on me until this day.

						Perhaps, the ‘bogeyman’ was never bad, but just as green and fragrant like my childhood leaves.</p>

						<h3>Flame Tree Leaf (Flamboyant Leaf)</h3>

						<p>In my elementary school years, my dreams have always been intertwined with the long branches of the

						“old giant” flame tree reaching over to my terrace from the school right next door. I remember secretly

						reading my sister’s yearbook and learning that if you remove the leaves from their stem, put them all onto

						the palm of your hand, and blow as hard as the wind, as they fall away, leaving a single precious leaf,

						your dream, green with youth, shall come true. The little beatings in my childhood all started from my

						school uniform shirt pocket overflowing with flame tree leaves, but I know in my heart that I have yet to

						finish dreaming!</p>

						<h3>Sponge Gourd Leaf (Luffa Leaf)</h3>

						<p>In Vietnam, luffa is traditionally used with small prawns to make comfort soups; my aunt often saves its

						leaves, washes then mashes them with salt and water to heal my coughs. Uncertain of the effectiveness

						of her remedy and despite how irritating my coughs were, I secretly poured it all away, nine times out of

						ten, lamenting the supple green leaves draping over the homey wooden trellis which. I told myself to do

						everything I could so that my little green hut would not lose another leaf again.</p>
					<?php elseif ($pageId == 6): ?>
						<h3>Vietnamese Perilla</h3>

						<p>When I was young, my mom had, on the window pane of the balcony, a pot of plant whose leaves are

						green on top and purple on the bottom. Mom called it “tia to” (Perilla), transliterated from the Japanese

						word “shiso” meaning “the purple plant of rebirth” … I used to be very scared of its stinkbug-like scent, but

						thanks to this very scent fused into one with warm congee that mom used to make to cure me of my cold.

						I will always remember those magical two-colored “medicine” leaves! Blending purple streaks with green,

						the skies of my childhood rush back to me with the warmth of every bowl of congee and of mom’s soft

						palms.</p>
					<?php elseif ($pageId == 7): ?>
						<h3>Aloe Vera</h3>

						<p>Grandma is very difficult, as difficult as the aloe vera plants she grows. Aloe vera is difficult to care for;

						grandma often yells at the grandchildren for not watering the plants when she is not home. Their leaves

						are stern and covered in thorns, enveloping a transparent and remarkably soft gut. Grandma uses it to

						make desserts or “che”, for the entire family to enjoy during the hot days of summer. It is because of how

						“difficult” grandma is that keeps the aloe vera healthy. That is grandma, just like the plant, cold and hard

						on the outside, but within a love for her family, so delicate, so soothing.
